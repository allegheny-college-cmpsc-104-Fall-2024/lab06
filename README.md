![Lab 6 Assignment](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-104-Fall-2024/lab06/blob/main/graphics/wiki.png)

## Project Goals
- Extend your personal portfolio created with Jekyll by creating a comprehensive GitHub Wiki to document the web project.
- Learn the importance of documentation, collaboration, and using markdown effectively.

## Tools
- A computer
- Internet connection for installation and documentation reference
- A GitHub account

## Learning Outcomes
These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the course syllabus:

1. Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
2. Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.
4. Identify and apply appropriate conventions of a variety of technical communities, tools, and computer languages to produce industry-consistent diagrams, summaries, and descriptions of technical topics or processes.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Wiki Pages
- Please create a `Home` page in the Wiki. This page should provide an overview of your Jekyll portfolio project, including its purpose and main features.

### Part 2: Add at least three additional pages:
- `Setup Guide`: Instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the project locally.
- `Features`: A detailed description of the key features of your portfolio site, including any customization or plugins used.
- `Contributing`: Guidelines for contributing to the project, including how to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests.

### Part 3: Using Markdown
- Use various markdown elements (headers, lists, links, images, code blocks) to format the pages. Include:
1. A table of contents on the Home page.
2. Installation instructions with code blocks on the Setup Guide page.
3. Bullet points and links on the Features page.

### Part 4: Advanced Documentation Tasks
- Add a sidebar to your Wiki for easy navigation.
- Embed screenshots or diagrams that illustrate your portfolio features or setup process.
